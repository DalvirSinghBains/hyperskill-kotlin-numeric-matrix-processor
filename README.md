# hyperskill-kotlin-numeric-matrix-processor
This repository conains all the code I wrote in Kotlin to complete the various project stages via Hyperskill learning platform. 

I've learned alot about different kotlin collections libraries, looping constructs, program control flow, kotlin Math library functions etc. The project was challenging for me but I didn't quit reason I wanted to improve my coding skills.

I persisted till  the end and completed all the project stages diligently. Used pen and paper to do lot of matrix related calculations before transforming those paper calculations into computer algorithms. My every second invested towards solving this project was worth it and taught me a lot. Now, I'm confident that I can map real life requirements and abstract problems into sub problems and devise computer algos to solve those problems.
